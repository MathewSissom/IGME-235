# Juggle Fever 
*a game concept by Matthew Sissom*

## Concept
In this goofy Bennet Foddy inspired arcade game the player tries to get a new high score by juggling as many balls as they can without letting any touch the ground.

## Story

In Juggle Fever the player plays as a clown in a circus setting. When they juggle properly the will get to feel all the highs that come with being a professional clown. The player will relish the heat of the spotlight, and be adored by cheering fans. If the player fails to juggle properly they will feel the crushing weight of disappointment, and know that they will never be the master juggler that their father wanted them to be. 

## Esthetics

The game will have a warm cartoonish feeling. Mostly warm colors will be used, a bright red curtain will be the main background, with the clown being dressed in orange, yellow, and white standing in front of it. The game will have circus music to accompany the player’s performance.

## Gameplay

### Mechanics

The player will play as a clown who stands facing the camera with both hands outstretched. If a juggling ball hits one of the player’s hands then it will be launched upwards with some random variation to it’s trajectory. If the player is moving, then the player’s horizontal velocity will also be added to the ball’s velocity. If a ball hits the left or right edge of the screen then it will bounce off of the edge. The player will be able to move their character left and right so they can catch the falling balls. At set time intervals additional balls will be thrown at the player from offscreen which they must catch and keep in the air. If a player misses a ball and it hits the ground, then the game is over.

### Controls

The player can move the clown left and right using the left or right arrow keys, or by pressing a and d. The character will intentionally be somewhat hard to control, having to accelerate up to his max speed, and to decelerate when he wants to stop.

### Teaching and player learning

This game is relatively simple, and requires very little to be taught to the player in order for them to learn how to play. A small in game instructions screen will be shown when the game is first started, and can be accessed again through the main menu. This screen will tell the players how to move, and that they must keep the juggling balls in the air for as long as possible.
