            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>
                When I started designing this website I wanted to capture the same sense of childlike joy that I wanted to convey in my game.
                 This meant I ended up reusing a lot of the ideas that I put into the game when I created the site. I ended up using almost 
                 the exact same color pallette as I did in the screenshots I drew. I think the warm pastel colors work really well with light 
                 blues and yellows to create contrast that is strong enough that it could fit in a circus setting, but isn’t overwhelming.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also chose to go with a very round look in most aspects of my design, which I feel further adds to that sense of childlike joy. 
                I picked fonts that were well rounded with excessive decoration for my title and nav bar. Although I would have liked to use a 
                similar font with the body text of my site as well, it would have been almost impossible to use a font in that style and still
                 have the main text be readable, so I ended up going with the roundest san-serif font I could find. I also put a large amount 
                 of padding around the body of my site with rounded corners to match with this rounded esthetic.
            </p>   
            <p>
                The last thing I did to add create a joyous experience was add interactivity to the site. The two things that I associate most 
                heavily with childish wonder are discovery and curiosity. I tried to incorporate this through css transitions and hidden easter 
                eggs. The links on my site have a very quick transition going from blue to yellow, which have the primary function of making 
                hovering over links less jarring, but also makes it really fun to quickly run the mouse pointer across the nav bar. The site 
                also features two other easter eggs. If the user hovers the mouse over “Juggle Fever” on any page then the text will slowly grow 
                larger and larger until it covers the entire page. Similarly the user can chase the footer off of the bottom of the screen by 
                hovering over it. Although these features wouldn’t be discovered by most users I think that the users that did find them would 
                enjoy them greatly, making it worth putting the effort in. I avoided putting easter eggs into the main text of the site because 
                I didn’t want to hinder the user if they just wanted to read the main content of the site. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall I enjoyed making this site and am happy with the end result.
