            <h2>Concept</h2>
            <p>
                In this goofy Bennet Foddy inspired arcade game the player tries to get a new high 
                score by juggling as many balls as they can without letting any touch the ground.

                <h2>Story</h2>
                <p>
                    In Juggle Fever the player plays as a clown in a circus setting. When they 
                    juggle properly they will get to feel all the highs that come with being a professional 
                    clown. The player will relish the heat of the spotlight, and be adored by cheering fans. 
                    If the player fails to juggle properly they will feel the crushing weight of disappointment, 
                    and know that they will never be the master juggler that their father wanted them to be. 
                </p>

                <h2>Esthetics</h2>
                <p>
                    The game will have a warm cartoonish feeling inspired by The Little Prince. Mostly warm pastel colors will be used, 
                    a bright red curtain will be the main background, with the clown being dressed in orange, yellow, and white standing 
                    in front of it. Juggling balls will have cooler colors so they stand out against the warm background. The game will have circus 
                    music to accompany the player’s performance.

                <h2>Gameplay</h2>
                <h3>Mechanics</h3>
                <p>
                    The player will play as a clown who stands facing the camera with both hands outstretched. 
                    The player will be able to move their character left and right so they can catch the falling balls.
                    If a juggling ball hits one of the player’s hands then it will be launched upwards with some 
                    random variation to it’s trajectory. If the player is moving when they catch the ball, then the player’s horizontal velocity 
                    will also be added to the ball’s velocity. If a ball hits the left or right edge of the screen then 
                    it will bounce off of the edge. At set time intervals additional balls will be thrown at the 
                    player from offscreen which they must catch and keep in the air. If a player misses a ball and it 
                    hits the ground, then the game is over.
                </p>
                <h3>Controls</h3>
                <p>
                    The player can move the clown left and right using the left or right arrow keys, or by pressing a and d. 
                    The character will intentionally be somewhat hard to control, having to accelerate up to his max speed, 
                    and to decelerate when he wants to stop.
                </p>
                <h3>Teaching and Player Learning</h3>
                <p>
                    This game is relatively simple, and requires very little to be taught to the player in order for them to learn 
                    how to play. A small in game instructions screen will be shown when the game is first started, and can be accessed 
                    again through the main menu. This screen will tell the players how to move, and that they must keep the juggling 
                    balls in the air for as long as possible.
