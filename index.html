        <p>
            I’ve always had more interests than I have time for. There aren’t enough hours in the day for me to go to class and do 
            my homework and play games and code personal projects and go climbing and cook and read and watch movies and go hiking. 
            That’s the main reason I chose to be a game design major, I loved how varied it was. I would be able to combine most, 
            if not all of my eclectic hobbies into one profession. The combination of digital art, animation, coding, design, and 
            narrative was too apealing for me to pass up. I’m also excited to be able to take this class, web design is interesting 
            to me in a very similar way to game design. I’ve enjoyed my time working with the web so far, and am excited to learn even more.
