        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Galaga is a vertical arcade shooter from Namco. You control a space fighter at the bottom of the screen,
            scrolling left and right in order to avoid oncoming bombs and kamikaze attacks from alien invaders--and 
            to fire your own missiles to fight back! There are an infinite number of stages to progress through. Every 
            third level is a "challenge stage" in which you have a free chance to shoot as many aliens as possible and 
            rack up bonus points. Certain aliens have tractor beams they can use to capture one of your ships. If that 
            wasn't your last "life," you can try to shoot that alien down and recapture your ship, giving you two ships 
            at once and doubling your firepower. A summary screen appears when the game is over, giving you both
            your final score and you final "hit ratio"--the number of missiles fired, enemies destroyed, and the
            percentage of targets hit.

        <h2>Quote</h2>
        <blockquote>
            There’s nothing like a simplistic, addictive game, particularly from the shooter genre, that you can return to 
            time and time again, regardless of new consoles, innovations in gaming, what-have-you, and have it still be as 
            fun as it was when you were a kid. For me, Galaga is one of the few games that can still do this on the NES, I 
            wouldn’t rank it above any of the bonafide, NES-born classics like Castlevania and Mega Man, but it holds a 
            special place in my heart for its reliability and fun. Galaga… will you marry me?<br>
